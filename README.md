The IoT-based parking system represents an intelligent approach to streamline and enhance parking management in urban settings. Employing ultrasonic sensors and the Arduino Nano 33 IoT, this system actively detects and monitors real-time parking space availability. Through a user-friendly <a href="https://parkin.fun/" target=_blank>web application</a>, drivers can effortlessly locate and reserve parking spots. The system not only facilitates easy access for drivers but also ensures the optimal utilization of parking spaces, thereby mitigating road congestion. Additionally, the inclusion of a QR code allows users to conveniently scan and access the portal.
